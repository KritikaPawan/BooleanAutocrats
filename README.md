# FAQ!
```
1. Why do merge confilcts occur?
```
> Ans. Suppose you forked the repository, now some other contributor who forked the same repository did some changes and added a PR , the maintainer will check it and finding no visible issues, will merge the PR to the main branch now the repository on your profile is frozen, the updates on the original repository don't reflect on the forked repository of your profile hence dont reflect on your local machine sice you cloned it before the changes. now since you create changes of your own in your local machine, and try to create a PR there will be a merge conflict because the original repository is ahead some changes which are not pulled down and implemented on your local machine,that is the reason of merge conflcits.

```
2. How to avoid merge confilcts?
```

> Ans. when you fork the repository there is a remote usually called 'origin' that is referencing to the forked repository on your profile. you have to add another remote usually called "upstream" that references the original repository , now before making any changes of your own, pull down changes made in the original repository using the command git pull upstream master and then the changes are reflected in your local machine now you can add changes and commit them CONFLICT-LESSLY.

```
3. Do we create another feature branch or work on the main branch?
```
> Ans. Yes, create a feature branch and work on that branch, don't make changes to the main/master branch.
